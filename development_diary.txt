I downloaded some sample data from http://www.repository.voxforge1.org/downloads/SpeechCorpus/Trunk/

20120919 5
Download the rest of voxforge
searching for kaldi tutorials looking at kaldi presentation (docsDropbox/KALDI_description.pdf)

Downloading of DOCS-kaldi.sourceforge.net
running online demo kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge/online_demo
===============Building kaldi ===============================================
    I am trying to run tutorial in /home/ondra/diplomka/kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge

    Seams 1-2 OK

    I followed instruction 
    1)for building kaldi-trunk/tools
    2)for building kaldi-trunk/src
    3) following instruction at http://vpanayotov.blogspot.cz/2012/07/voxforge-scripts-for-kaldi.html
       a) downloading data OK
       b) trying to run /home/ondra/diplomka/kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge/online_demo need to make kaldi-trunk/src/onlinebin than it worked fine 
       c) running s5/run.sh
         have to modify /home/ondra/diplomka/external_voxcforge/extracted/mramige-20100820-thj/wav/a0008.wav

    1)
    CPU throtling problem
    You can not edit files with CPU performance directly /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cscaling_governor for cpu0 (for cpu1 just replace cpu0)

    I needed to change cpu frequency management
    original set up was ondemand
    I changed it from "ondemand" to "performance via
    sudo cpufreq-set performance   # turns off CPU throtling 

    I installed via
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall libc6-dev
    to solve error 
    /usr/include/features.h:323:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h


    2)
    in /home/ondra/diplomka/kaldi-trunk/src/configure
    I changed ATLAS/build/install/lib to  ATLAS/build/install/lib
    twice on lines: 168, 235




    3)a) fixed path - not escaped and path /media/My Book has to be escaped:)

Reading HTK book 

<<<<<<< HEAD
20121015 ?
Set up redmine repo for documentation of my thesis.
Add openfstbc - bash completition for openfst to .bashrc_local
Compiling and running KALDI training on cluster 
    is NOT WORKING and SHOULD BE AVOIDED!:
    -> CPU throtling problem for Atlas libraries
    -> can not disable cpu throtling on every blade on cluster
    -> use loki machine instead -> compilation OK
TODO running http://vpanayotov.blogspot.cz/2012/07/voxforge-scripts-for-kaldi.html the tutorial on cluster /home/ondra/diplomka/kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge/s5
    -waiting to download voxforge- screen session on lrc2 with interactive login for downloading

20121026
    I should using autoconf, automake, libtool for deploying C code. All available at loki.
    It needs M4 macro preprocessor which is available at loki in enough version 1.4.13

    Installing HTK -> installing srilm & running for cs
        problems on my home machine I needed to install dev-tcl package and I edited common/Makefile.machine.i686  and set up TCL_INCLUDE= -I/usr/include/tcl8.4 and also change tcl to tcl8.4
        still can not find ngram tool
        help found at http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/manpages/srilm-faq.7.html
        Building srilm ok at T400

         not single job despite jobs=1 -> USE RENICE 20!

    Installed HTK -> todo setup config files

20121019 2
    Meeting DRSG -> should use PEP8  -> autopep tools http://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/
    pip install --upgrade autopep8
    PEP8 definition http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

 rewriting notes from the meetings:
 Jan Svec ASR bez LM
 FSM - Finete State Machine
 pjsip C- extension Python
 PIL- Python interpreter lockm runs only 1 thread at one time
 Probabilistic Graphical Models - Daphne Koller (read it)- BP - belief propagation, EP - expected propagation
 GIT - hooks for git - autopep,... postponed
 realtime for ASR == 100ms -> my GOAL
 labeler counts gaussians 
 modes for ending and starting recognition
     PTT - Push to talk
     PTA - Puretone average
 boost python - nice wrapper for C++ even for python 3.x
 use nice, renice commands on loki
 Honza Trmal - contact for ?

 ASR with HTK and Kaldi
    use English data
    monophone->3phone->clustering
    For Kaldi use the same parameters -> use HParam settings from HTK
    I should see error rate around 20%
    HWite look at 2 bigram LM - SLRM-LM tools
 KALDI uses google c++ style guide and I should use cpplint.py
 FINISHED training HTK-scripts except exporting models for Julius ASR
    not used export_models.sh (mkbinhmm & mkbinhmmlist not INSTALLED)

20121109
 Doxygen is not installed on loki / grid but Doxygen 1.7.6.1 is at u-pl21 at mff lab
 tip:   use a cell phone for any presentation with ASR , phones does things for you
        -> noise reduction, volume normalisation ...
 perform KALDI training using nothing special we used for HTK:
  triphone - interword, cepstral mean normalisation, acceleration by mfcc?  
 multipy python -> I have to use the python version for invocation e.g.
    (2.7)ondra@T400$ python2.7 do-my-job.py
 nemam pristup na ssh oplatek@vystadial
 I can use sol11,sol12,sol13
 I copied CUDA-SDK do unlimited cluster, added nvvc to PATH and 
 on twister1 should be GPU for CUDA (It looks like lspci found sthing)
20121111
 SET UP notes: I set up mosh
  HOW I BUILD this for mosh-1.2.3?
  I added ln -s protobufs/include and protbufs/google
  Manually edited genereted makefiles after
  $ protobuf_LIBS='-pthread -lprotobuf -lz -lpthread' protobuf_CFLAGS=-pthread ./configure --prefix=/home/oplatek/tools/mosh-1.2.3/mosh-install
  then I fixed /usr/bin/protoc   -> protobufs/bin/protoc in mosh-1.2.3/src/protobufs/Makefile
  then I fixed LDD_FLAGS in src/frontend makefile
  HOW TO USE MOSH
  http://mosh.mit.edu/#usage

20121114
 HBuild creates a loop for phonems iff I provide
 HBuild phonetic dictionary with "A  phonetic transcription of A\n, B  phonetic transcription of B\n, .." 
 HVite '-p' parameter .... silence threshold, (short words will be occurring instead of silence)
        -p -10 ... less words in sentence -> silence will be occurring more
 Hresult -t parameter shows difference among  the tested transcribed sentence 
 and the recognized transcription of the given sentence
 Htkbook page 51
 HTK Live input
 set sourcerate 1/Sample rate .... in 100ns so 625.0 is for 16 000 sample rate
 HTK can show n-best hypothesis for live input even for incomplete sentences 

 Hmm clustering - phonetic symbol independent -> cluster phonems based on raw vector.

20121115
 Updating and reading /ha/home/oplatek/50GBmax/kaldi/kaldi-trunk/egs/vystadial/s5/run.sh
 Localising changes which hast to be done from voxforge -> vystadial modification
20121123
 ASR with vystadial will get only chunks of wav files and will output chunks of characters.
 Vystadial doc is at https://vystadial.ms.mff.cuni.cz/doc/install.html
 genereted by apidoc and updated by every push to vystadial/doc - git hooks
